This is the archived source code of a bukkit plugin from ~2018, handling generic 
pre-external verification restrictions for players. This includes cancelling 
most unverified player events, using a mysql database (also connected to an 
external website that handles registration, IP address checking and captcha 
verification), and keeping track of player coordinates for proper respawning.

A significant amount of strings have been [redacted].
